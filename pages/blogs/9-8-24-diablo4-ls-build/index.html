        <h1><strong>Diablo 4: Lightning Spear Sorcer Build</strong></h1>
        <p>So far, during the current season of Diablo, I've been playing as a sorcerer. Because of the new uniques and changes made before season 4 released an ability the sorcer has called lighnting spear has become an extremely viable and powerful build option. So far, after aroung 65h of gameplay on the character and still haven't even fully maxed the character yet.</p>
